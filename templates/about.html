    <h4>
      The goal of Database for Medication Safety in Geriatric Patients (DMSG) is
      to:
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Gives access to both BEERS criteria and STOPP/START criteria
        recommendation for drug classes and medications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allows healthcare professional from the same healthcare institute to
        share notes with each other regarding each drug or drugclass
        recommendation to enhace patient care.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Guidelines:</h4>
    <p>
      BEERS criteria and STOPP/START criteria are two most prominent guidelines
      for healthcare professionals to help improve the safety of prescribing
      medications for older adults. BEERS criteria is a guideline published by
      American Geriatric Society in 2015 to identify potentially inappropriate
      medication use in geriatric population. You can click

      to view the full publication of BEERS criteria. STOPP (Screening Tool of
      Older Personsâ€™ Prescriptions) and START (Screening Tool to Alert to Right
      Treatment) are explicit criteria that facilitate medication review in
      multi-morbid older people in most clinical settings. You can click
